# LKMVC

A simple PHP framework providing a MVC workflow that is suitable for api development or website development or both if you really want to. Includes database connector using PDO. 

## Installation

Clone this repo into your root directory
in `config/database.php` set your own database variables
in `public/.htaccess` change `RewriteBase` (line 4) to your own path to the public folder

## Usage

You can change how this framework behaves using the `SECOND_PARAM_METHOD` (found in `/config/core.php`). With this set to true, URLs are processed as `www.example.com/controller/method/param1/param2/...`. With this set to false, URLs are processed as `www.example.com/controller/param1/param2/...`.

When adding your own endpoints, you must name your controller and model classes to match the endpoint name. For example the `www.example.com/test/` endpoint must have a file named `/controllers/Test.php` and `/controllers/TestModel.php`. 

Depending on `SECOND_PARAM_METHOD`, the controller class must include a method that follows the following naming convention:

 - If `SECOND_PARAM_METHOD` is true, the name must be the endpoint's second parameter followed by the http request method. For example in `www.example.com/test` the method would be `TestGet` or `TestPost`
 - If `SECOND_PARAM_METHOD` is false, the name must be `http` followed by the http request method. In the above instance this would be `httpGet` or `httpPost`.

A test endpoint is included that will return whatever string you send to it as a JSON object.

## Database Class

The database class includes methods to perform SELECT, UPDATE and INSERT queries once the class has been instantiated.

Each method takes a `$sql` parameter which should be your query using named parameters. The `$args` parameter must be an array in the following format: `['param_name' => ['value', PDO::PARAM]]` or `['param_name' => 'value']` and it will automatically interpret the data type.

The `$db->select()` method will return your results as an array. `$db->update()` will return the number of rows updated and `$db->insert` will return the ID of the last inserted record.

Failed Insert or Update commands will be reverted on failure. `last_error` is available as a property that will contain the last PDO error.
